# STM32CubeL1 MCU Firmware Package

**STM32Cube** is an STMicroelectronics original initiative to ease developers' life by reducing efforts, time and cost.

**STM32Cube** covers the overall STM32 products portfolio. It includes a comprehensive embedded software platform delivered for each STM32 series.
   * The CMSIS modules (core and device) corresponding to the ARM(tm) core implemented in this STM32 product.
   * The STM32 HAL-LL drivers, an abstraction layer offering a set of APIs ensuring maximized portability across the STM32 portfolio.
   * The BSP drivers of each evaluation, demonstration or nucleo board provided for this STM32 series.
   * A consistent set of middleware components such as RTOS, USB, FatFS, graphics, touch sensing library...
   * A full set of software projects (basic examples, applications, and demonstrations) for each board provided for this STM32 series.
   
The **STM32CubeL1 MCU Package** projects are directly running on the STM32L1 series boards. You can find in each Projects/*Board name* directories a set of software projects (Applications/Demonstration/Examples). 

In this FW Package, the modules **Middlewares/ST/TouchGFX** and **Middlewares/ST/STemWin** are not directly accessible. They must be downloaded from a ST server, the respective URL are available in a readme.txt file inside each module.
