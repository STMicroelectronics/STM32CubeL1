@par Example Description 

How to use a comparator peripheral to compare a voltage level applied on a GPIO
pin to the the internal voltage reference (VREFINT), in interrupt mode. When the 
comparator input crosses (either rising or falling edges) the internal reference 
voltage VREFINT (1.22V), the comparator generates an interrupt.


In this example, the comparator is connected on pin PA.01. 
Each time comparator input crosses VREFINT, LED3 toggles.
If LED3 is toggling successively: This indicates that the system generates an error.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides 
      accurate delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. 
      This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then 
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower) than the 
      peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked. 
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set 
      to 1 millisecond to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32L1xx devices.

  - This example has been tested with STM32L152C-Discovery board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32L152C-Discovery Set-up

    - Use LED3
    - Apply an external variable voltage on pin PA.01


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
