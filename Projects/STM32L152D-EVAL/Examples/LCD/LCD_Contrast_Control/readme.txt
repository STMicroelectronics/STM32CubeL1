@par Example Description 

How to use the embedded LCD glass controller and how to set the LCD contrast. 

The ADC1 is configured to converts continuously ADC channel31 when using the 
STM32L152D-EVAL. 

Each time, an end of conversion occurs, LCD GLASS contrast is updated.
The messages displayed on the Pacific Display LCD glass (XHO5002B) mounted on 
STM32L152D-EVAL board is proportional to each LCD Contrast level.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This
      implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then 
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L1x2xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152D-EVAL
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.   

  - STM32L152D-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect a variable power supply 0-3.3V to ADC Channel31 mapped on pin PF.10
      (potentiometer RV3).
    @note Make sure that the embedded LCD GLASS is in LCD position.
    @note Make sure that
        Jumper 6 (JP6) is in position 2<-->3 (SEG1).
        Jumper 8 (JP8) is in position 2<-->3 (SEG0).

  - JP7  jumper should be in position 1-2.
  - JP12 jumper should be closed.
  - JP13 jumper should be fitted in ADC position.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
