@par Example Description 

How to calibrate the OPAMP peripheral.

On OPAMP1, this example shows how to 
- Get factory calibration (trimming) settings.
- Enable/disable OPAMP
- Calibrate OPAMP peripheral before and after use of OPAMP.
  Hence changes can be monitored (versus factory settings or in case of 
  temperature impact for instance).

- Connect an oscilloscope to DAC_CHANNEL_1 output (pin PA.04) to display the sine wave signal
  generated by the DAC. 
- Connect an oscilloscope to OPAMP1 output (pin PA.03) 
  -> to display the OPAMP buffered sine wave signal.
  -> Monitor enabling/disabling of OPAMP.
- Push the Key Push button (connected to PA.00 pin) to switch from one step to the 
next one.
- Key push button steps are:
  -> 1st Push: 
     + Factory trimming retrieved 
     + User trimming set according to self calibration (1st run)
     + Factory trimming and user trimming are compared
       - If The LED blinks rapidly: Calibrated trimming are different from Factory Trimming
       - ................. slowly : Calibrated trimming same as Factory Trimming 
  -> 2nd Push: 
     + OPAMP start
     + Use of previously calibrated user Trimming values
  -> 3rd Push: 
     + change OPAMP setting on the fly (dummy change, without application purpose in this example: change non-inverting input source)
  -> 4th Push: 
     + OPAMP stopped    
  -> 5th Push: 
     + Self calibration (2nd run)
     + results compare to 1st run.
       - If The LED blinks rapidly: New calibrated trimming are different from ones calibrated before run
       - ................. slowly : New calibrated trimming are same as ones calibrated before run 
  -> 6th Push: end of test

@par Hardware and Software environment  
  
  - This example runs on STM32L1xxxC, STM32L1xxxCA, STM32L1xxxD and STM32L1xxxE devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32L152D-EVAL board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32L152D-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect an oscilloscope to pin PA.04 to display DAC_CHANNEL_1 output waveform.
    - Connect an oscilloscope to pin PA.03 to display OPAMP1 output waveform.
      @note LCD glass should be removed to connect PA3 to oscilloscope.
  
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
