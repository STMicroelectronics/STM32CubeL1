@par Application Description

Use of the USB device application based on the Human Interface (HID).

This is a typical example on how to use the USB peripheral in Device mode with HID class V1.11
following the "Device Class Definition for Human Interface Devices (HID) Version 1.11
Jun 27, 2001". The example is built around the USB device library and emulate the joystick by moving
the host mouse pointer horizontally.

This example supports the remote wakeup feature (the ability to bring the USB suspended bus back
to the active condition), and the Key button is used as the remote wakeup source.

By default, in Windows OS, the USB mouse Power Management feature is turned off. This setting
is different from classic PS/2 computer functionality. To enable the Wake up from  standby
option, user has to manually turn on the Power Management feature for the USB mouse.

To enable the wake from standby option for the USB mouse, the following steps have to be followed:
 - Start "Device Manager",
 - Select "Mice and other pointing devices",
 - Select the "HID-compliant mouse" device (make sure that PID &VID are equal to 0x5710 & 0x0483 respectively)
 - Right click and select "Properties",
 - Select "Power Management" tab,
 - Finally click to select "Allow this device to wake the computer" check box.

The function GetPointerData() is responsible to move the mouse cursor automatically,
which can be easily customized (square, circle...).
In this application the cursor is moving forward and backward in an infinite loop.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset all the peripherals,
initialize the Flash interface and the systick. The user is provided with the SystemClock_Config()
function to configure the system clock (SYSCLK) to run at 32 MHz. The Full Speed (FS) USB module uses
internally a 48-MHz clock, which is generated from an integrated PLL.

@note To reduce the example footprint, the toolchain dynamic allocation is replaced by a static allocation
      by returning the address of a pre-defined static buffer with the HID class structure size.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on the the SysTick ISR. Thus if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, the SysTick interrupt
      must have higher priority (numerically lower) than the peripheral interrupt, Otherwise the caller ISR process
      will be blocked. To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function
	  or statically define it in the HAL configuration file through the "TICK_INT_PRIORITY" define.

@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL configuration.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L152xE devices.

  - This example has been tested with STM32L152RE-Nucleo Rev C board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32L152RE-Nucleo RevC Set-up
    Since there is no USB 2.0 Full speed connector (Type B) on the nucleo board, user has to make
	his own USB shield daughter board with the a USB connector and plug it on top of the  CN8 and CN9
	connectors of the STM32L152RE-Nucleo. The USB connector has to be connected to the USB device associated GPIOs
	as follows:
       - DP (D+ of the USB connector) <======> PA12 (Nucleo board) CN10 connector PIN 12
       - DM (D- of the USB connector) <======> PA11 (Nucleo board) CN10 connector PIN 14
	To improve EMC performance (noise immunity and signal integrity), it is recommended to connect a 100nF
	ceramic capacitor to the USB VDD pin.

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
