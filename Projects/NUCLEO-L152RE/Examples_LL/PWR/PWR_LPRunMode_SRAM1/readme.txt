@par Example Description

How to execute code in Low-power run mode from SRAM1.

In the associated software, the system clock is set to 2.097 MHz, an EXTI line
is connected to the User push-button through PC.13 and configured to generate an 
interrupt on falling edge upon key press.

After start-up LED2 is toggling FAST(100-ms blinking period), 
indicates that device is running at 2.097 MHz.

The User push-button can be pressed to set system in LowPowerRun mode (Freq: 65KHz). 
In this case LED2 toggling SLOW(400-ms blinking period).

LED toggling speed is controlled by variable "uhLedBlinkSpeed".

@note To measure the current consumption in Run mode, remove JP6 jumper 
      and connect an ampere meter to JP6 to measure IDD current.
      NB: LED2 have an impact on power consumption. 
          Remove LED2 blinking to have a stable power consumption, 
          comment line  "#define USE_LED" in main.c file  

@note This example is executed from SRAM1 to decrease power consumption.
      Flash is deactivated during LowPowerRun mode activation. 
      This example cannot be executed in standalone mode, so using debugger is mandatory to run this example.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L152xE devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L152RE-Nucleo Rev C
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.

  - STM32L152RE-Nucleo Rev C Set-up
    - LED2 connected to PA.05 pin
    - User push-button connected to pin PC.13 (External line 15 to 10)

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
