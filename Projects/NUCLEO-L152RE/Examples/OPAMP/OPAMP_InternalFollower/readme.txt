@par Example Description

How to configure the OPAMP peripheral in internal follower mode 
(unity gain). The signal applied on OPAMP non-inverting input is reproduced on 
OPAMP output.


Other peripherals are used in this example:
 - DAC generates continuously a signal on OPAMP2 non-inverting input (internal connection: no external connection needed)
   This signal can be observed on pin PA.04 (output of DAC_CHANNEL_1 has been connected to this GPIO pin for debug)

   Note: External connection between DAC output and OPAMP non-inverting input is possible:
         Change OPAMP init parameter "NonInvertingInput" from "OPAMP_NONINVERTINGINPUT_DAC_CH1" to "OPAMP_NONINVERTINGINPUT_IO0",
         then connect a wire between pin PA.04 (output of DAC_CHANNEL_1) and pin PA.06 (non-inverting input of OPAMP).

 - ADC acquires the signal on OPAMP2 output (internal connection: no external connection needed)
   This signal can be observed on pin PB.00
   
   Note: ADC conversion results are stored into array "aADCxConvertedValues" (for debug: check into watch window)            */
         These results can be compared to reference waveform "Waveform_Ramp_12bits_5samples".                                       */

 - DAC and ADC are clock by the same timer TIMx: DAC on TIMx rising edge, ADC on TIMx falling edge
  (in order to have for each sample of DAC waveform a stabilization time of 1/2 TIMx clock cycle, then ADC acquisition of this sample).


To run the example:
 - There is no external connection needed to run this example
 - Optionally, for this example purpose: pressing on User push-button enable/disable OPAMP
   to watch the impact on OPAMP output voltage and LED status.

STM32L152RE-Nucleo Rev C board's LED is be used to monitor the program execution status:
 - Normal operation: LED2 is turned-on/off in function of OPAMP output vs input voltage
   comparison status:
    - Turn-off if OPAMP output is different of non-inverting input
    - Turn-on if OPAMP output is equal to non-inverting input
 - Error: In case of error, LED2 is toggling at a frequency of 1Hz.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32L1xx Cat.3, Cat.4, Cat.5 devices.

  - This example has been tested with STM32L152RE-Nucleo Rev C board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board. 

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
