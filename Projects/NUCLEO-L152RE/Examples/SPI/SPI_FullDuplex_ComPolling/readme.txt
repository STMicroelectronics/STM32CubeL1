HAL architecture allows user to easily change code to move to IT or DMA mode. 
To see others communication modes please check following examples:
SPI\SPI_FullDuplex_ComDMA
SPI\SPI_FullDuplex_ComIT

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
clock (SYSCLK) to run at 32 MHz.

The SPI peripheral configuration is ensured by the HAL_SPI_Init() function.
This later is calling the HAL_SPI_MspInit()function which core is implementing
the configuration of the needed SPI resources according to the used hardware (CLOCK & 
GPIO). You may update this function to change SPI configuration.

The SPI communication is then initiated.
The HAL_SPI_TransmitReceive() function allows the reception and the 
transmission of a predefined data buffer at the same time (Full Duplex Mode) 
The user can choose between Master and Slave through "#define MASTER_BOARD"
in the "main.c" file.
If the Master board is used, the "#define MASTER_BOARD" must be uncommented.
If the Slave board is used the "#define MASTER_BOARD" must be commented.

For this example the aTxBuffer is predefined and the aRxBuffer size is same as aTxBuffer.

In a first step after the user press the User push-button, SPI Master starts the
communication by sending aTxBuffer and receiving aRxBuffer through 
HAL_SPI_TransmitReceive(), at the same time SPI Slave transmits aTxBuffer 
and receives aRxBuffer through HAL_SPI_TransmitReceive(). 
The end of this step is monitored through the HAL_SPI_GetState() function
result.
Finally, aRxBuffer and aTxBuffer are compared through Buffercmp() in order to 
check buffers correctness.  

STM32 board's LEDs can be used to monitor the transfer status:
 - LED2 toggles quickly on master board waiting user button to be pressed.
 - LED2 turns ON if transmission/reception is complete and OK.
 - LED2 toggle slowly when there is a timeout or an error in transmission/reception process.   

@note SPIx instance used and associated resources can be updated in "main.h"
      file depending hardware configuration used.

@note Timeout is set to 5 Seconds which means that if no communication occurs 
      during 5 Seconds, a Timeout Error will be generated.

@note You need to perform a reset on Slave board, then perform it on Master board
      to have the correct behaviour of this example.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L1xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32L152RE-Nucleo Rev C board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32L152RE-Nucleo Rev C Set-up:
    - Connect master CLK (PC10 connected to pin1 on CN7 connector) to Slave CLK (PC10 connected to pin1 on CN7 connector)
    - Connect master MISO (PC11 connected to pin2 on CN7 connector) to Slave MISO (PC11 connected to pin2 on CN7 connector)
    - Connect master MOSI (PC12 connected to pin3 on CN7 connector) to Slave MOSI (PC12 connected to pin3 on CN7 connector)
    - Connect Maset board GND to Slave Board GND

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
    o Uncomment "#define MASTER_BOARD" and load the project in Master Board
    o Comment "#define MASTER_BOARD" and load the project in Slave Board
 - Run the example
